## Read the entire README before beginning. Commit often.

## Important Note

This is a timed assessment.  You should be able to complete it in under 3 hours.  Remember to commit and push to your forked repository. At the _very least_, you should commit after each test passes. We will use the timestamps to evaluate how long it took.

## Project Description

The app is a REACT front end for the message board API built in (galvanize-message](https://github.com/gSchool/galvanize-message).  Your REACT app will interact with your deployed galvanize-message API.

## You are responsible for:

- [ ] Forking and cloning this GitHub Repo.  create-react-app has been run for you.
- [ ] Ensuring your galvanize-message API is up and running.
- [ ] Creating the React components to build a front end and properly interacting with the API
- [ ] Styling your components with bootstrap or materialize (note: this requires importing them into your App and adding appropriate classes to your HTML)
- Use immutable pattern when manipulating the state of the messages
- [ ] Add components to:
+ List all Messages displaying name and message
+ Add a new Message (include a button to hide/show the compose form)
+ Delete a Message
+ Add a Toolbar at the top with a search filter and a display of the count of the messages 
+ Bonus: add update functionality
+ Bonus: Use Redux for you state management
- [ ] Deployment of your React app to Heroku (separate url or same as your API)
